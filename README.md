# Modification_of_Rabin-Krap
Our inspirational algorithm was Rabin-krap which is used in searching strings. 
The need for modification in this algorithm arose because of its limitation to cater large strings. So, to solve this particular problem we used an algorithm to generate hash function i.e. MD5- message-digest algorithm which produces 128 bits hash value. Earlier we had a problem of maintaining the size of the decrypted message but now it would be 128 bits irrespective of the size of the string which enable us to search big words, lines and even paragraphs in a particular document without worrying about the length of string. 
The following are the options we provide in our code:
•	Find first occurrence of a word
•	Find all the occurrence of a word
•	Find the occurrence of a line
•	Find the occurrence of a paragraph
